## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using the following command on the command line.

git clone git@github.com:ocarvente/play-sheet-io.git

2. Change directories to the newly cloned repository.

cd play-sheet-io

3. Install dependencies

npm install

### Setting up the PostgreSQL Database

To use this application and its full functionality, you need to set up your PostgreSQL database. Here are the steps to get your database up and running:

1. **Download and Install PostgreSQL**:

- Refer to the [official PostgreSQL download page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) to choose the correct installation for your situation. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Create a Database**:

- After PostgreSQL is installed, you need to create a new database for the application. You can use the PostgreSQL command-line tool (`psql`) or a graphical interface like pgAdmin to create the database.

CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

### Apply the Schema and Data

In the root directory of the cloned repository, you'll find a SQL schema file named `postgresSchema.sql`. Follow these steps to apply the schema and initial data to your PostgreSQL database:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Use the `psql` command-line tool to connect to your PostgreSQL server and apply the schema:

   psql -h your_database_host -U your_database_user -d your_database_name -a -f postgresSchema.sql

Make sure to replace the placeholders (your_database_host, your_database_user, and your_database_name) with your actual database connection details.

Execute the command, and it will create the necessary tables and populate them with the initial data defined in the postgresSchema.sql file.

### Configure the .env file

1. In the root directory of the cloned repository, create a .env file if it doesn't already exist.

touch .env

2. Open the .env file in a text editor of your choice and add the following configuration information, replacing the placeholders with your actual database connection details:

HOST=your_database_host
PORT=your_database_port
USER=your_database_user
PASSWORD=your_database_password
NAME=your_database_name

Replace the placeholders as described above.

3. Save and Close .env file

Now, your application is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database with the schema and initial data provided in the postgresSchema.sql file. You can proceed with running the application by following the instructions in the README.

If you encounter any issues during this setup process, please don't hesitate to reach out for assistance.
